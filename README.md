Totally a Readme here. Nothing to see. Move along, move along.
============

The makey makey interface is feature complete and mostly styled.
 - alphanumeric datastream ID not firing properly. [low priority]
 
 Map and Sound interface now has map and information pulling on click.
 - style the output of the clicking to enable selection.
 
Other stuff is outlined, just needs dropping in to place.

Project has now been split in to two subdirectories; mapping and makeyMakey.

Mapping is for the mapping and sound synthesis side of the project.

makeyMakey is for the input side of the project, consisting of the information pushing sections.
