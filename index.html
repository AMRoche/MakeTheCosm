			<h2>Welcome to Make The Cosm!</h2>
			<p>
				Even though the third party service is now called "Xively" from "Cosm", the entire project is titled based on a pun, so that's not changing.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Mapping segment takes an API key and search term and creates an interactive geographic graph of the data, which the user can assign sounds 
				to to also create dynamically changing music.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Input segment also takes an API key, and then enables the user to connect any USB keyboard device and stream to Xively using it as an input device.
			</p>
			<p>
				As this is an academic project instead of a labor of love, there is much tedious writing involved, which can be found <a href="dissertation/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Owing to the recent re-branding of Cosm to Xively, the videos accompanying this project are outdated, but there are more on the way soon!
			</p>
			<p>
